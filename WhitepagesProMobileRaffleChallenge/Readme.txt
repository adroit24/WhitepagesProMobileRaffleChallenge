OVERVIEW

Reverse Phone queries for all the records relating to a single phone number. Reverse Phone search returns the people, 
locations, and business related to it.

HOW TO COMPILE SAMPLES:
======================
1- If using Visual Studio 2012, open WhitePagesPhoneLookup.sln solution and build it.
2- For Visual Studio 2013, open WhitePagesPhoneLookup.sln instead. Also, see NOTES below regarding web.config changes.
3- In Solution Explorer, use Set As Start Page to set Phonelookup.aspx and set WhitePagesPhoneLookup as StartUp 
   Project as an entry point.

HOW TO RUN SAMPLES:
==================

1- With ASP.NET Development Server (Visual Studio built-in)
2- Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3- If not done before, set Phonelookup.aspx as start page and set WhitePagesPhoneLookup as StartUp Project so that 
   it would load automatically instead of directory listing.
4- Start the solution.

NOTES:
=====
The samples for Visual Studio 2012 use the same sets of source code files. web.config files for these versions, 
however, should be a bit different. If you're on Visual Studio 2013, follow instructions in web.config to make 
it compatible with Visual Studio 2013 requirements.
